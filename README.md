# Frontend Technical Interview

## Structure

Each folder's name represents some scope of task. Preferably to have some small steps with increasing complexity on each
next step. Also could be a `solution.js` with some approximate possible solution.

## Idea

- start from the 1st task's step
- when the task is accomplished then we can take the next step's code and provide it to the candidate. **Note**: the
  code should be fully working, but without full solution of the current step
- if there is no enough time to accomplish the task, then we should accurately explain to the candidate that
  accomplishment is not the main goal and he/she can just describe by words how this could be accomplished. After that
  we can switch to the next task
